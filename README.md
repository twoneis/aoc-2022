# AoC 2022
AdventOfCode 2022 in Rust by someone who can't code in Rust :)

## Goals
Maybe understand Rust a bit and get some (basic) experience with it. (Also to force me to get up early and fix my sleep schedule a bit at least.) I don't expect my code to be any good and i'm not competing for a top spot in any leaderboard, but just doing this for fun and for the challenge. To really learn the fundamentals i try to avoid using pre-coded fragment but i won't go out of my way to make sure to never copy-paste anything from previous days.
